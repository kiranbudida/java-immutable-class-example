# Immutable Employee Example

This Java project demonstrates how to create a custom **immutable class (`Employee`)** that contains another **mutable class (`Address`)**, while ensuring immutability using **defensive copying**.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

- `Address.java`: A mutable class representing address details.
- `Employee.java`: An immutable class that holds an Address object using defensive copy.
- `Main.java`: Test class to demonstrate immutability.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated

- Immutable Class Design Principles
- Defensive Copying of Mutable Objects
- Final Classes and Fields
- Safe Getter Methods

## âœ… How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-immutable-class-example.git
